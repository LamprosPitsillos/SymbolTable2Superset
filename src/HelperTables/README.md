# Why?
Some rules couldn't be checked with just `SQL` querying ,as I would prefer.
Creating Tables based on specific rules for each smell would be easier, and faster for the DB, but would limit on the 
range of queries asked on the database since the rules and data are already in the *pre-build* tables.
